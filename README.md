## Implemented Features  
---
Classification system, made using NLP, is able to classify a post into different channels.🎏    
  
Resume Screening: Implemented a resume screening system which upon reading a file generates a pie chart depicting areas of expertise of the user. This feature is beneficial for both the recruiters and potential candidates.🧐      
    
We trained the ChatBot, we integrated it on our website. The chatbot responds perfectly and helps the user to navigate our cause as well as the website.🤖    
    
Added the social page, which will help user to join any existing community by sending request or create any new community to discuss things, they always wanted to.💌      
    
Book the Interview with the accomplished people in their fields like Law, research, Human Resources, and Assistant Editors.💬📆    
    
Support Our Cause - Interviewee can send some money from her first salary/ stipend/ scholarship to  her mentor/ Interviewer as a token of thanks to keep them motivated and this will encourage more people to participate as interviewers.💵💸

## Themes/Use Cases: 
### Social Good:  
  
– A lack of diversification in the industries is an ongoing problem and is important to address if we want to create solutions that cater to every section of the population.👩🏽👧🏻👭👩    
    
– With Empowher, we aim to support women in their careers. Since women face a lot of passive aggressive comments and messages on career portals, we decided to make a safe space only for women where they can access relevant opportunities without all the negativity.🔇   
    
– Women understand what fellow women may be going through like imposter syndrome, being under confident, apologizing too much and hence have curated sections like interviews by accomplished women in respective fields, Resume Screening and connecting with female role models to boost their career.✨👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏼
