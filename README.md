## Themes/Use Cases: 
Social Good:  
  
– A lack of diversification in the industries is an ongoing problem and is important to address if we want to create solutions that cater to every section of the population.    
– With Empowher, we aim to support women in their careers. Since women face a lot of passive aggressive comments and messages on career portals, we decided to make a safe space only for women where they can access relevant opportunities without all the negativity.   
  
– Women understand what fellow women may be going through like imposter syndrome, being under confident, apologizing too much and hence have curated sections like interviews by accomplished women in respective fields, Resume Screening and connecting with female role models to boost their career.
